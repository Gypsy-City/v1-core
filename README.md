# Gypsy Protocol v1 alpha

This repository contains the smart contracts source code and markets configuration for Gypsy Protocol V1 alpha. The repository uses Hardhat as development environment for compilation, testing and deployment tasks.

## What is Gypsy?

Gypsy is a tokenized REIT protocol where users can participate as investors or residents. Investors provide capital to invest in homes to earn a passive income, while residents are able to pay to live in the homes. Everytime a resident pays rent they gain home ownership.
